# Networked VR

This tutorial will show you how to write your very first multi-user virtual reality experience on the web.

You might be thinking: wait you can do VR on the web? And the answer is yes! Using the WebVR standard and an awesome library called A-Frame, VR on the web is actually really easy and evolving rapidly. Your second question is then: wait to do multi-user won't I have to know all about servers and complicated networking protocols? Answer: not anymore! The recently released Networked-Aframe (NAF for short) has you covered. NAF hides away a lot of the networking complexity, allowing you to write multi-user VR apps entirely in HTML.
